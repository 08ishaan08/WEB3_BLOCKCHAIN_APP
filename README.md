# WEB 3 TRANSACTIONS APP USING BLOCKCHAIN

This project aims to build a Web3 Transactions Application which has two sides:
  1. Client side 
  2. Smart Contract

What we used in this project
- How to connect a regular React.js application to the blockchain and pair it to your Ethereum wallet using MetaMask
- I learnt how to write Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network using the #Solidity programming language
- Essentially, in this single project, I learnt how to create a full-fledged Web 3.0 application that allows users to send transactions through the blockchain
